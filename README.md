# CTF

This web app is a beginners CTF webpage that teaches basic web security principles. It opens up to a basic webpage with a login screen that the user should attempt to bypass. To start this, clone the repository and enter the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the server and enter the provided URL to connect (http://127.0.0.1:8000/). 

I wrote this software to learn the basics of Django and build my first CTF website.
